      "description1": "Sunrise Awakening Yoga is a Mellow Flow class. Mellow Flow classes are a softer pace. Often early morning practises, we prepare our mind and bodies for the day ahead. Gentle but purposeful movement, working out all the kinks and releasing tension. Often there is a focus on mobility and targeted movements.

      "description1": "Flow classes are all about tapping into your inner rhythm. Syncing mind, body and breath as we move seamlessly from space to space. This is a strong and dynamic practise where we build heat and a little sweat, challenging our boundaries and the preconceptions we have of our own bodies. Winding down with some deep stretches and a deliciously relaxing savasana.",
