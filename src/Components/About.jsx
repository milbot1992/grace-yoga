        <h2 className='about-header-1'>Grace trained as an Awakening Yoga teacher in 2021. All of her classes are inspired
by the Awakening Yoga system from Patrick Beach and Carling Harps. Awakening
yoga is a modern expression of yoga. More accessible to different body types and
helping you to carve out space for exploration, mindfulness and fun! Graceâ€™s classes
are a blend of old and new, traditional and modern, with a focus on mobility and
functional movement.</h2>

                    <p className='about-me-text'>I trained as a dancer when I was younger, so movement for me has always been a
treasured form of self-expression. I like to bring a piece of that into my classes, a
sense of purpose in movement and that powerful feeling of being part of something
as a group when you&#39;re moving through the same dance but in different ways. In my
classes we explore self-discovery, playfulness and trying new things, in a safe space
where there is no right or wrong, just what feels good.</p>
